\section{1. Project Description}\label{project-description}}

Sports play a massive role in American Culture. However, over the past
two years there has been a 2\% decrease in both male and female athletes
who participate in athletics at the high school level. This research
will explore hypotheses as to why involvement with sports has decreased
by analyzing participation in the four major US sports; football,
baseball, soccer and basketball.

\begin{center}\includegraphics{ProjectProposal_files/figure-latex/Graph 2-1} \end{center}

Initial observations for the boys sports shows that football had the
most consistent decrease in participation from year to year. Soccer, for
both boys and girls sports, was the only sport to have an increase in
participation consistently year over year. Therefore, an initial
hypothesis that individual sports are changing in popularity and
therefore chaning overall participation will be studied.

Another initial hypothesis is that national popularity of a given
professional sport will indicate high school participation. The plot
above demonstrates a similar trend in NFL Superbowl viewership change
year by year as high school football participation. Professional soccer
could be gaining popularity year by year and could be a good explanation
as to why its consistently gaining popularity on the high school level.

\hypertarget{potential-data-sources}{%
\section{3. Potential Data Sources}\label{potential-data-sources}}

To complete the research, data representing the popularity of all four
major professional US sports will be collected. Second, injury
statistics will be introduced with the hypothesis that higher risk
sports are becoming less popular year by year. This data could be used
to describe why Football has a decline in participation. Finally, data
expressing the cost to play each sport will be introduced with the
hypothesis that cost will explain some of the decline in participation.
