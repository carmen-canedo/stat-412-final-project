# Hypothesis
The third hypothesis we are looking predicts that sports with high instances of injury will also have steady declines in participation.

# Data
The data used are as follows:

  + Youth emergency visits among US children for sports-related brain injuries from 2010-2016
  + US annual average emergency department visits for all sports injuries 2010-2016
  + US emergency department visits ages 5 to 24 from 2010 to 2016 by gender and activity
  + Percent of concussions in US youth that play sports as of 2017
  + Survey on the long-term effects of concussions in sports
  + Average annual number of US college female sports injuries during the fall season from 2009 to 2014
  + Average annual number of US college male sports injuries during the fall season from 2009 to 2014
  + Average annual number of US college for all seasons from 2009 to 2014 by gender
  + High School Participation Archive
  + Program for Injury Prevention, Education, & Research
